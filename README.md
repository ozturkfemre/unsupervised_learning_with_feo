# Unsupervised Learning with feo

[![](images/unsupervised_learning_with_feo-01.png)](https://ozturkfemre.github.io/unsupervised_learning_with_feo/)

In this project, I covered topics that every data wizard should know about Unsupervised Learning, one of the most fundamental building blocks of machine learning.

I hope that this small booklet, which includes information about how the topics below work, how they are calculated step by step, and how they are implemented in the R programming language, will be useful for anyone interested in unsupervised learning.

You can also find cheat sheets at the end of each chapter.

You can access the booklet using [this link](https://ozturkfemre.github.io/unsupervised_learning_with_feo/).

At the end of the booklet you will find a section entitled Exercises. In this section you are expected to apply all the topics covered in this booklet using the R programming language.

May the algorithms be with you!
