# Unsupervised Learning with feo Booklet

In this project, I covered topics that every data wizard should know about Unsupervised Learning, one of the most fundamental building blocks of machine learning.

I hope that this small booklet, which includes information about how the topics below work, how they are calculated step by step, and how they are implemented in the R programming language, will be useful for anyone interested in unsupervised learning.

**Table of Content**

1.  What is unsupervised Learning?
2.  Choosing optimal number of clusters
3.  k-means
4.  k-medoids
5.  Hierarchical Clustering
6.  Density Based Clustering
7.  Cluster Validation Metrics
8.  Principle Component Analysis

You can also find cheat sheets at the end of each chapter.

You can access the booklet using [this link](https://ozturkfemre.github.io/unsupervised_learning_with_feo/).

At the end of the booklet you will find a section entitled Exercises. In this section you are expected to apply all the topics covered in this booklet using the R programming language. You can find the answer key by sending me a private message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozturkfemre/).

May the algorithms be with you!
